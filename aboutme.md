My name is Sawyer Huang. I am a student earning a Master of Engineering in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell University. I also earned my Bachelor of Arts in Information Science from Cornell University. On campus, I have been active in Zeta Psi, Cornell Barbell Club, the CUTonight Commission, Cornell University Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, and the Class of 2022 Council.

I am from Gardiner, NY. When I'm not working, I enjoy powerlifting, spending time with friends, listening to hip-hop, playing video games, and trying new restaurants. Here are some pictures of my favorite memories over the past year!
